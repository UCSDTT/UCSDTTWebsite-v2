### Setting Up

Make sure you're in your own branch before you start developing.

It is very important to ensure that you have a package.json file in your development directory including the following:
```
"devDependencies": {
  "react-scripts": "0.8.5"
},
```

With that, run npm start to get the localhost address and paste it into a web browser to see what the website looks like so far.
